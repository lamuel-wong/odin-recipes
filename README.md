# Recipe Website

## Introduction

This project is designed to build a basic recipe website using HTML. The goal is to practice and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of HTML, including creating links, structuring content with various HTML tags, and organizing the site’s content in a simple yet effective way. 

The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipe pages, each containing information such as the ingredients and instructions for each recipe. While the visual appearance of the website won’t be the focus for now, it will serve as a strong foundation for future improvements with CSS styling.


## Skills Demonstrated

In this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- **HTML Structure:** I used various HTML tags to properly structure the content of the recipe website.
  
- **Creating Links:** I created links between different pages of the website using `<a>` tags, allowing users to navigate between the index page and recipe pages.

- **Organizing Content:** I organized content for readability and clarity using tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>`. Sections such as ingredients, instructions, and additional notes are separated and clearly structured.

- **Tables and Lists:** I listed ingredients using unordered lists (`<ul>`) and organized instructions using ordered lists (`<ol>`). Where necessary, I used tables to present information in an easy-to-read format.


## Project Overview

- **Main Page (index.html):** This page contains a list of links to individual recipe pages. It serves as the homepage for the website.
  
- **Recipe Pages:** Each recipe page features:
  - Recipe name
  - Description
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  
## Future Improvements

In future versions of this project, I plan to:
- **Style the website with CSS** to enhance the visual appearance.
- **Add images** to make the recipes more visually appealing and informative.
- **Enhance accessibility** further by using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks and ensuring better keyboard navigation.
