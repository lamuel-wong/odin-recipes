# Recipe Website

## Introduction

This project is designed to build a basic recipe website using HTML. The goal is to practice and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of HTML, including creating links, structuring content with various HTML tags, and organizing the site’s content in a simple yet effective way. 

The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipe pages, each containing information like the ingredients and instructions for each recipe. While the visual appearance of the website won’t be the focus for now, it will serve as a strong foundation for future improvements with CSS styling.
