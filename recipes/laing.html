    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Laing</strong> is a delicious <em>Filipino</em> dish made from dried taro leaves cooked in a rich, spicy
        coconut milk sauce. The leaves are simmered until tender, absorbing the creamy coconut flavor, and usually
        spiced up with chili and seasoned with shrimp paste (bagoong). It's a perfect balance of heat, creaminess, and
        umami. Traditionally served with steamed rice, Laing is a favorite comfort food in many Filipino households,
        especially in the Bicol region where coconut milk is a staple ingredient.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bundle dried taro leaves (Laing leaves) or 4 cups fresh taro leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, julienned or minced</li>
        <li>2 cups coconut milk (preferably from a can or fresh)</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut cream</li>
        <li>2-3 long green chili peppers, sliced</li>
        <li>1-2 red chilies, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shrimp paste or fish sauce</li>
        <li>1-2 cups water (adjust depending on the consistency you want)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pork belly or shrimp (optional for added protein)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Taro Leaves:
            <ul>
                <li>If using dried taro leaves, soak them in warm water for about 30 minutes to rehydrate. After
                    soaking, drain well and set aside.</li>
                <li>If using fresh taro leaves, wash thoroughly, remove the tough stems, and chop into smaller pieces.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Pork Belly and Aromatics:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the pork belly (and shrimp optionally) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pieces are
                    browned and the fat has rendered, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sauté the onions and garlic until softened and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the Shrimp Paste:
            <ul>
                <li>Stir in the shrimp paste (or fish sauce) and cook for another 2-3 minutes to meld the flavors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the Taro Leaves and Ginger:
            <ul>
                <li>Gradually add the prepared taro leaves to the pot, do not stir. If using fresh leaves, be sure to
                    cook them thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Add the ginger, and the sliced green and red chilies.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the Coconut Milk and Cream:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour in the coconut milk</li>
                <li>Let the taro leaves simmer in the milk for 15-20 minutes in medium low heat, pat gently to ensure
                    the leaves are cooked evenly.</li>
                <li>Pour in the coconut cream. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a gentle simmer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Simmer:
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the dish simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. The taro
                    leaves will soften and absorb the flavors of the coconut milk, pork belly, and shrimp paste.</li>
                <li>If you’re adding shrimp, include them during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking to avoid overcooking.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Season and Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. If the dish is too salty, you can add a little
                    water to balance it out.</li>
                <li>Once the taro leaves are tender and the sauce has thickened to your liking, remove from heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve your Laing hot, paired with steamed white rice. Enjoy the rich, spicy, and creamy goodness!</p>
