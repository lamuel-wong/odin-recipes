        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter (for finishing)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped or 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth (or white wine/squeeze of lemon for extra depth)</li>
        <li>1 cup spinach (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil or parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Salmon:
            <ul>
                <li>Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sear the Salmon:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the salmon fillets, skin-side down (if using skin-on).</li>
                <li>Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden and crispy. Remove the salmon from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the Creamy Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium and add a little more olive oil if needed. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the sun-dried tomatoes (or cherry tomatoes) and cook for 2-3 minutes, letting them soften.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add Liquids and Spinach:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour in the heavy cream and chicken broth (or white wine), stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes, letting the sauce thicken slightly.</li>
                <li>Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish the Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>Add the grated Parmesan cheese, dried basil, and Italian seasoning. Stir until the cheese melts and the sauce becomes creamy.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Return Salmon to the Pan:
            <ul>
                <li>Gently place the seared salmon fillets back into the skillet, spooning some sauce over the top. Let the salmon simmer in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes, until heated through.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Drizzle the creamy sauce over the salmon fillets and garnish with fresh basil or extra Parmesan if desired. Serve immediately with a side of your choice—like pasta, rice, mashed potatoes, or roasted vegetables.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
