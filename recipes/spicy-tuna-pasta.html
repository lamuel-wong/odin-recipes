            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>1 can (about 150g) tuna in olive oil or brine (drained and flaked)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (use oil from the tuna if you prefer)</li>
        <li>2-4 fresh chili, finely chopped (adjust to spice preference)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>200g spaghetti (or your choice of pasta)</li>
        <li>1 cup spinach (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>A handful of dried oregano or parsley</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Crispy Topping:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stir in the breadcrumbs and cook, tossing occasionally, until the breadcrumbs are golden and crispy, around 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with a pinch of salt, then drain the breadcrumbs on a paper towel to remove excess oil. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Pasta:
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions, until al dente.</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta, reserving a bit of pasta water for later.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the Tuna Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or use oil from the tuna) in a large frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped chili and garlic, sautéing until soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the flaked tuna and stir to combine. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, breaking up the tuna into smaller chunks as it cooks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Combine the Pasta and Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the tuna is heated through, add the cooked spaghetti to the pan.</li>
                <li>Toss to combine, adding a splash of pasta water to help the sauce coat the pasta evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chopped spinach and parsley, cooking for another minute until the spinach wilts and the parsley is evenly distributed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve
            <ul>
                <li>Plate the pasta, topping with the crispy garlic breadcrumbs for an added crunch.</li>
                <li>Garnish with a little extra parsley, if desired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
